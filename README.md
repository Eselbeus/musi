```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install musi

## Usage

.sharp is a method which will raise the input of a note given as a string by one half step
.flat is a a method which will lower the input of a note given as a string by one half step
.raiseP5 raises a note by a perfect fifth

Currently only these 4 actions available.
